<h1>Be Sovereign — MVP Document</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<strong>Be Sovereign</strong> is a digital declaration of independence. Users sign an on-chain declaration affirming their commitment to data sovereignty, self-custody, and digital rights.

<strong>Live:</strong> https://besovereign.xyz

<h2>The Problem</h2>

We gave our data to big tech. Our photos, messages, and memories are:
<li>Stored on servers we don't control</li>
<li>Governed by terms we didn't read</li>
<li>Deleted at their will</li>
<li>Monetized without our consent</li>

Most people don't realize the extent of their digital dependency until a platform bans them, shuts down, or changes its terms.

---

<h2>The Solution</h2>

A public declaration that:
<li>**Articulates** the principles of digital sovereignty</li>
<li>**Captures** signatures on-chain (permanent, uncensorable)</li>
<li>**Builds** a community of people committed to these values</li>

---

<h2>The Five Principles</h2>

<li>**Data Ownership** — Your data is your property. You created it. You decide who accesses it.</li>

<li>**Self-Custody** — You have the right to hold your own keys and not depend on any single provider.</li>

<li>**Portability** — Your identity, reputation, and history must move with you.</li>

<li>**Interoperability** — Systems should speak to each other. No walled gardens.</li>

<li>**Privacy by Default** — Surveillance requires explicit consent. The default is silence.</li>

---

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<li>User visits besovereign.xyz</li>
<li>Reads the declaration and principles</li>
<li>Enters name + optional message</li>
<li>(Optional) Connects wallet for verified signature</li>
<li>Signature is recorded on Arkiv (Golem Foundation's decentralized storage)</li>
<li>Signature is permanent and uncensorable</li>
