# Be Sovereign — MVP Document

## Overview

**Be Sovereign** is a digital declaration of independence. Users sign an on-chain declaration affirming their commitment to data sovereignty, self-custody, and digital rights.

**Live:** https://besovereign.xyz

## The Problem

We gave our data to big tech. Our photos, messages, and memories are:
- Stored on servers we don't control
- Governed by terms we didn't read
- Deleted at their will
- Monetized without our consent

Most people don't realize the extent of their digital dependency until a platform bans them, shuts down, or changes its terms.

## The Solution

A public declaration that:
1. **Articulates** the principles of digital sovereignty
2. **Captures** signatures on-chain (permanent, uncensorable)
3. **Builds** a community of people committed to these values

---

## The Five Principles

1. **Data Ownership** — Your data is your property. You created it. You decide who accesses it.

2. **Self-Custody** — You have the right to hold your own keys and not depend on any single provider.

3. **Portability** — Your identity, reputation, and history must move with you.

4. **Interoperability** — Systems should speak to each other. No walled gardens.

5. **Privacy by Default** — Surveillance requires explicit consent. The default is silence.

---

## How It Works

1. User visits besovereign.xyz
2. Reads the declaration and principles
3. Enters name + optional message
4. (Optional) Connects wallet for verified signature
5. Signature is recorded on Arkiv (Golem Foundation's decentralized storage)
6. Signature is permanent and uncensorable
